# PINNACLE - A3 - Montara

## Overview

The third continent, known as Montara, is a rugged and mountainous landmass situated to the west of Elysara and Meridonia.
The inhospitable terrain has led to a sparse population, with only a few small settlements and outposts scattered throughout
the region. Montara's rich mineral deposits and strategic locations have nonetheless attracted the attention of various
powers over the centuries.

### Northern Montara

Veridian Outpost - The remnants of a castle originally belonging to a now-destroyed kingdom, taken over by the Kingdom
of Veridia several hundred years ago. The outpost, featuring non-Veridian architecture, is in a state of disrepair. It
stands as a somber reminder of the brutal past and overlooks a ruined city, haunted by the ghosts of its former inhabitants.

Ruin's Edge - A small town settled by the descendants of the survivors from the destroyed kingdom. The people here have
learned to adapt to the harsh conditions of Montara and preserve the memory of their ancestors.

Ironshore - A coastal village responsible for transporting ore from the nearby mining village. The hardy inhabitants of
Ironshore have developed a robust maritime trade and are skilled sailors.

Stonemine - A mining village nestled in the mountains, where the inhabitants extract valuable minerals and metals from
the earth. The village has a strong connection to Ironshore, as they rely on the coastal town for trade and supplies.

### Southern Montara

Freeport - A free city situated in a habitable area with a natural port, unaffiliated with any kingdom. The city's
residents value their independence and have established a thriving community that welcomes travelers and merchants from
across the world. Its strategic location and political neutrality make it an attractive destination for trade and diplomacy.

Silverpeak - Another mining town in the southern region of Montara, known for its rich deposits of silver and other
precious metals. The miners of Silverpeak work tirelessly to extract these valuable resources and trade them with the
inhabitants of Freeport and beyond.

### Summary

Despite the challenges posed by Montara's rugged landscape, the inhabitants of this continent have shown remarkable
resilience and resourcefulness. The various settlements across Montara have forged alliances and trade networks,
contributing to the development of a unique culture that reflects the continent's storied history and unforgiving environment.
