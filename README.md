# PINNACLE

## Overview

Pinnacle is a CRPG, inspired by the classic 80's CRPGs of my youth; over a living gameworld that progresses with the Player's help, or hinderance.  Each game is unique, with the fate of the world resting on the choices the player makes.

The world of Pinnacle is a multiverse, with an `Order` universe and a `Chaos` universe. You can read more in the [Docs](./docs/00-INDEX.md)

There are some restricted assets in this project that are placeholders, and will be replaced with original assets as the project progresses.
